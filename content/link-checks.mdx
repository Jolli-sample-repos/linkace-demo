# Link Checks

LinkAce has a nice feature called Link Checks. If you [set up your cron](/docs/v2/configuration/system-settings/) correctly, LinkAce will regularly take a chunk of links from your collection and check if the links are still accessible.

## Requirements

To enable link checks, you need to configure the following environment variable in your `.env` file:

```
LINK_CHECKS_ENABLED=true
```

## How does this work?

With the help of the cron, LinkAce will perform the Link Check every hour. When started, LinkAce pulls 100 links from the database and then run the check on each link.

The check determines the status of each link:
- **Working links** return status codes `200`, `301`, or `302`
- **Moved links** are links that have been redirected (301/302 status codes)
- **Broken links** are links that return error status codes or are unreachable

If LinkAce found at least one moved link *or* one broken link, it will email the user containing details about the moved or broken links. The user can then react to this and check what happened to the link.

Moved or broken links are highlighted in the user interface.

## Disable link checks

There can be several reasons why a link is or becomes unavailable, or broken in terms of LinkAce. If you receive multiple notifications that a link is broken, you can also disable the checks for this particular link. To do so, go to the corresponding link details page. On the right-hand side you will notice a button "Disable check" and the current status. Clicking the button will disable any further checks.

If you want to enable checks again, just click the button again.
